## Overview
This documentation provides an overview of the Software Development Kits (SDKs) available for developers to integrate with and extend the functionalities of the Enhanced Environmental Management App. SDKs are available for various programming languages, offering a simplified way to interact with the app's APIs.

## SDKs Available
- **Python SDK**: For backend integration and data analysis scripts.
- **JavaScript SDK**: Ideal for web applications and interactive dashboards.
- **Java SDK**: Suitable for Android app development and cross-platform desktop applications.

## Getting Started with SDKs
Each SDK comes with its own set of tools, libraries, and documentation to help you get started. Here are the general steps to begin using an SDK:

### Installation
- Python SDK: `pip install EnvironmentalAppPythonSDK`
- JavaScript SDK: `npm install environmental-app-js-sdk`
- Java SDK: Available on Maven Central as `com.environmentalapp.sdk`

### Configuration
- Obtain API keys from the Environmental Management App platform.
- Configure the SDK with your API keys and set up your development environment.

### Making API Calls
- Refer to the specific SDK documentation for details on making API calls, handling responses, and managing errors.

## Sample Code
Below is a sample code snippet using the Python SDK to fetch air quality data:

```python
from environmental_app_sdk import EnvironmentalClient

client = EnvironmentalClient(api_key='your_api_key_here')
air_quality = client.get_air_quality(location='New York')
print(air_quality)
```

## Documentation and Support
Detailed documentation for each SDK, including API reference, code examples, and best practices, is available on the app's developer portal. For support, join our developer community forum or submit a ticket through the support portal.
