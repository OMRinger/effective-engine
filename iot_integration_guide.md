# IoT Integration Guide

## Introduction
Integrating IoT (Internet of Things) sensors into environmental monitoring applications enhances real-time data collection capabilities, providing valuable insights into air and water quality, temperature, humidity, and more.

## Selecting IoT Sensors
- Consider sensors for air quality (PM2.5, CO2 levels), water quality (pH, turbidity), temperature, and humidity.
- Ensure compatibility with your IoT platform of choice (e.g., AWS IoT Core, Google Cloud IoT Core).

## Setting Up IoT Sensors
1. Configure each sensor according to manufacturer instructions.
2. Establish a secure connection to your IoT platform.
3. Test data transmission to ensure reliable operation.

## Processing Sensor Data
- Implement data processing scripts to normalize and analyze incoming data.
- Store processed data in a database for historical analysis and real-time monitoring.

## Conclusion
Properly integrated and configured, IoT sensors are invaluable for collecting diverse environmental data, enabling more informed decision-making and predictive analytics.
