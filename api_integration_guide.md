# API Integration Guide

## Overview
Integrating external APIs can significantly enhance an environmental monitoring app by providing access to additional data sources and enabling data sharing.

## Using Environmental Data APIs
1. Identify relevant environmental data APIs (e.g., weather, pollution indexes).
2. Register for API access and obtain necessary authentication credentials.
3. Use HTTP requests to fetch data, handling rate limits and response parsing.

## Exposing an App's API
- Design a RESTful API to allow access to collected environmental data and predictive analytics.
- Implement authentication and authorization to secure access.
- Document available endpoints, request/response formats, and example uses.

## Conclusion
Effectively integrating external APIs and exposing an app's functionalities via its own API can extend its capabilities, foster development of third-party applications, and encourage community engagement.
